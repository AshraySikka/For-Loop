# For-Loop

This Python script demonstrates two fundamental uses of the `for` loop:

1. Looping through a range of numbers.
2. Looping through each character in a string.

## 📄 What It Does

- Prints numbers from 0 to 9 using a `for` loop and `range()`.
- Iterates over the characters in the string `"hello"` and prints each character on a new line.

## 📁 File

- `for-loop.py`: Contains the example loops.

## ▶️ How to Run

Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python for-loop.py
